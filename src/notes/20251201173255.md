shout out to [Taxodium](https://taxodium.ink/), who made their own [album wall page](https://taxodium.ink/album-wall.html) inspired by my [music page](/music) and the [blog post](/blog/music-page/) about it. it made me very happy to see this! I’ll be sure to listen to the albums they listed.

they [mentioned](https://taxodium.ink/46.html#A3F5CC4B-4E1F-44F0-B769-384CB07110AE) that my previous ImageMagick implementation was better looking. it’s great that a past iteration of my page lives on in their site… also their album page looks great with the “Dark 👾” theme
