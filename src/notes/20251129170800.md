![A high-contrast, black-and-white manga-style illustration. A female character with oversized, intense eyes looks down with concern at her left forearm, where a wire or tube appears to be inserted directly into the skin. She grips her arm near the connection point. Behind her to the left creates a surreal contrast: a simple, floating, balloon-like head with a minimalist face (two dashes for eyes and a line for a mouth) hovers in the darkness. The drawing utilizes heavy black shading and cross-hatching textures.](/assets/images/gallery/surfresponsibly.png)

I love this piece of art by [Tomáš Rodr](https://triapul.cz/)
