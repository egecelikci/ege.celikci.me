I'm trying out the personal wiki/digital garden approach for content management. I had orphan pages like [Miniflux rules](/miniflux) and I'm thinking of putting them inside the [wiki](/wiki) instead of a one simple page like `/pages` (idk). Since the [notes](/notes) page looked like it was going to replace the [blog](/blog), I removed the blog page from the navbar; I guess blogging isn't for me. I might one day turn blog post(s) into wiki page(s). I'm very confused right now because I don't have much content, so I'm open to suggestions from those who can help me create a roadmap.
